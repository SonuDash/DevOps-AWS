## 1. Project-1
### AWS Resource Tracker
This project will automate the weekly resources usage information logging for a company thereby saving a lot of precious time of the organisation and the team working on a particular project. I have implemented the shell script in an ubuntu based EC2 instance and integrated it with crontab for regular timely updation.

**Resources used:**
- Ubuntu shell
- Ubuntu EC2 instance
- Crontab
